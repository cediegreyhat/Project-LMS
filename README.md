## **Introduction**
The **Tool Management System** is a full-stack project designed to streamline inventory management for tools. It supports functionalities like tool borrowing, returning, tracking, and maintaining tool conditions. This system ensures ease of use for both admins and users while providing reliable database storage with an intuitive interface.

---

## **Motivations**
This project was developed as part of a final assessment for a **Computer Engineering course** to apply knowledge of software engineering, databases, and user interface design. 

The motivation stems from:
1. The need for efficient tracking of tool inventory in educational and workplace settings.
2. Addressing real-world challenges like misplaced tools, insufficient quantities, and manual record-keeping.
3. Providing a professional and collaborative learning experience for team members with varying skill levels.

## **Features**
### Functional Requirements
1. **User Roles**:
   - **Admin**: Manage inventory (add, delete, update tools).
   - **Regular Users**: View and borrow tools.
2. **Tool Management**:
   - Add, edit, delete, and search tools.
   - Track tool quantities and conditions.
3. **Transaction Management**:
   - Borrow and return tools.
   - Record transactions with timestamps.
4. **Database**:
   - SQLite-based database for persistent and offline storage.
5. **GUI**:
   - Future integration of a user-friendly interface for interaction.

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Local Execution**:
   - Entirely offline functionality for secure and reliable operations.
2. **Simplicity**:
   - Clean design focusing on ease of use and functionality.

## **Roadmap**
### Week 1: Development Timeline
| Day  | Task                          | Details                                                                 | Deliverables                     |
|------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 1    | Project Setup                 | Define the database schema, initialize environment.                    | `inventory.db` with schema      |
| 2    | Backend Development           | Implement CRUD operations for tool management.                         | Functional backend               |
| 3    | Basic Interface               | Create GUI layout and implement basic forms (e.g., add tool).          | GUI for tool addition            |
| 4    | Borrow/Return Features        | Add borrow/return logic and integrate into the database.               | Borrow/return functionality      |
| 5    | Search and Reporting          | Search tools, generate basic reports (e.g., overdue tools).            | Search and reporting features    |
| 6    | Testing and Debugging         | Comprehensive testing, bug fixes, and sample data validation.          | Stable system                    |
| 7    | Documentation and Final Touches | Prepare user manual, project report, and final presentation.           | Complete project documentation   |
